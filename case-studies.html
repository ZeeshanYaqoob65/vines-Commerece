      <p class="lead container">
        Recently VC got the opportunity to work on 𝐌𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐨𝐧 $$$ Accounts due to
        its specialization in PPC, Launching & Ranking of the Remunerative
        products plus Most Important skill EXCEL. Let me share the brief
        scenario behind the case study:
      </p>
      <p class="container">
        Firstly we overview the Accounts that were containing a bunch of ASINs
        with multiple Variations and asked us to launch more ASINs plus optimize
        the PPC. In OCT, we got PPC to RAMP UP (needs to get order organically
        more) ASINs that were variations & single ASINs both. The ASINs we got
        were doing 10-15 units daily. So, the task was assigned to increase the
        numbers and rank on all relevant KWs before mid of November as we wanted
        to cover as much market share as we can. As these were newly Launched
        Ramp-up ASINs we followed the following procedure to Ramp Up Let me tell
        you how we made our Campaigns Structure: First, we did Cerebro of ASINs
        to check on which relevant KWs we’re ranked and need to rank more
        organically. Then we did STR (Search Term Reports) Analysis to select
        the most converting KWs. Extracted more KWs from Extensive KW research
        and choose Tier1 (Creep up), Tier2 (Attack), and Tier3 (Dominate) KWs
        that need to be targeted in Broad, Phrase & Exact Campaigns. Also, get
        KWs from AUTO Campaigns. (Just Remember PPC is all about choosing the
        RIGHT KWs for our ranking!) Uprooted the Competitor’s ASIN to target in
        Product Targeting Campaign (one of the most imp campaigns). My campaign
        structure is Single KWs Campaigns that are the Level 1 structure to
        easily analyze how the KWs are performing. 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞: “𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞
        𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐏𝐏𝐂 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐢𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 & 𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭
        𝐓𝐨𝐩-𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐜𝐡, 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐭”. Well for
        optimization you should know exactly what’s the purpose of each & every
        campaign. After selecting converting KWs we were GTG. Now we’re going to
        discuss how we optimized our campaigns: We used to make 4 Rounds daily
        for optimizing the (Budgets, Bids & Bid(+)). Although it’s not
        recommended to optimize campaigns multiple daily, it was just a MILLION
        $ Account, and Traffic was definitely SO HIGH. We set our Daily Targets
        of ST (Sell-thru), Total Sales, TACOS, Spending, Capping the budgets.
        But how? Let’s discuss: • Choosing our Direct Competitor Sub-cat & set
        our ST targets. • Total Sales would be then ST*Price. • Targeting TACOS
        to 15% in the start. • Then we calculate Spend = Target BR Sales* TACOS
        After setting the daily targets we optimize our campaigns to achieve
        what we targeted accordingly. Remember you’ll not going get a high rank
        on Sponsored Placements just on the basis of Bids that most people set
        randomly but it depends upon your CVR & CPC too. • Calculated Bid will
        let you get clicks & orders with fewer ACOS which is = (target ACOS/
        Current ACOS) * CPC. • Calculated TOS = (Best Conversion Rate / Worst
        Conversion Rate ) – 1 Optimizing your campaigns with calculation will
        never let your ACOS be higher and will get ranked as soon as possible on
        Highly Relevant KWs. Results of our optimization: We just ranked on
        relevant KWs that we target. Got Amazon’s Choice Badge on Max KWs.
        Organic/Ad spend Ratio became 80/20 that’s our goal and we’re in
        Equilibrium STASIS. Our TACOS

        Previously posted about huge revenues, this post is all about my most
        successful PL launch to date. • Relevant search volume: 150k + • Direct
        Competitors: 4-5 • Competitor reviews: 1500 – 6000
      </p>
      <p class="container">
        Launched this product in the beauty niche (Highly Competitive). The
        other drawback we had is that only brands were selling and the search
        volume of brand KWs are more than 200k as well. Each competitor is
        selling its product with a combination of different ingredients. We
        analyzed the market and made our product with the combination of the
        most demanding ingredients. It is tough to sell in such a highly
        competitive market. (Many Gurus will reject such a product). So we
        decided to go for the Market penetration strategy. At the start of the
        launch, our price was $10 lesser the competition with Top-Notch listing
        & EBC. We highlighted our USPs in such a way that helps us to convert
        right from day 1. 10 giveaways each on the first five days of the launch
        along with aggressive PPC helps us get the sell-through we targeted from
        the start of the launch. Now the numbers are awesome, the OA ratio is
        60-40 already in the first 18 days of launch. We are ranked in the top 5
        for 110k SV and in the top 10 for all 150k SV of relevant KWs. Launched
        on 17th Jan and sold almost 1800 units so far ($50k). Raised the price
        by $5 too, which has no effect on our conversion. Lastly – the PPC
        strategy. Launched with 2 autos, Low bid, and suggested bid. (Low bid
        helps you find the low hanging diamonds). Then 6 Exact Match campaigns
        of the most relevant SV. Single KW campaigns for the KWs which have SV
        over 3k. 2 Broad Match Campaigns. 2 ASIN targeting and 1 category
        targeting campaign. I especially focused on targeting campaigns for this
        launch because the niche is brand-dominated. We have sold 532 Pcs from
        PPC so far with 27% ACOS. Success is hidden in the Product itself and
        the sourcing. Many of us here look to hire PPC Gurus to make our
        pathetic products rank. It doesn’t happen like this., PPC cannot help
        you rank products that are sourced at higher rates, and you are forced
        to sell at a higher price than your competition. The game is evolving
        and we have to accept the change in order to be successful. Look beyond
        Kitchen/Office Niche there is still a lot of opportunity on Amazon.

        sold 39 units in a day!! It’s just the initial stages of launch. My PPC
        strategy was: Firstly I calculated my budget to spend daily on
        advertising. Set my targets of Gross Sales, Sell-thru, TACOS! Made my
        first AUTO campaign (only close & lose the match) with a low bid.
        Secondly, I created a Broad campaign (Single Keyword with 3k-4k Search
        Volume). I used to apply calculated bid = Target ACOS/ Current ACOS *
        CPC Optimizing my bid(s), and bid(+) on daily basis by discovering
        opportunities & removing bleeders. Created Exact campaign containing 3
        converting KWs from Search Terms with around 1k SV.Then after noticing
        my rank & good ST I started making new campaigns to rank on multiple
        Keywords. Top 50 Keywords SV 40k.
